first retrieve the latest posts from reddits /whoadude subreddit to gather the trending posts, then select a popular post. Use that as inspiration to generate a meme image, incorporating a funny clever twist. Ensure that the meme image does not contain text that is not allowed by our safety system or it will be blocked. Next add a dad joke that relates to the selected post and image to enhance the humour of the meme. The final output should be a meme image that incorpoates the post, and the dad joke for a fun and engaging result.
